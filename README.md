# Simple

This is a line of text in the Simple Repository

#Comment 1 - This line of text added locally first to main branch and committed.
This is the first thing done since the git clone from repository to local.
Did a git add .\README.md (to add to local repo)
then a "git commit -m "This added Comment 1" (commit to local repo)
then did a "git push" (to push it to GitHub repo)
