# Simple

This is a line of text in the Simple Repository

# Comment 1 - This line of text added locally first to main branch and committed.
This is the first thing done since the git clone from repository to local.
Did a git add .\README.md (to add to local repo)
then a "git commit -m "This added Comment 1" (commit to local repo)
then did a "git push" (to push it to GitHub repo)

# Comment 2 - This was added in the Test branch of the GitHub Repo online (not locally)
...and the changes committed.
It seems that the local repo will update with a "git pull" only after something has changed in the remote repo.
A "git branch" did not show the Test branch until I changed this file an did a "git pull"

# Comment 3 - this was just to test the "git add *" command
